            <p>When Selena Quintanilla was a famous maxican american singer. Selena’s father Abraham Quintanilla has been teaching his daughter to sing ever since she was a little girl. He wanted her to sing for the world. Selena was great at singing in spanish even though she was not that good of speaking it. She was famous in the United States and Mexico for her talent. One of her famous songs was “Como La Flor”. Selena's dream was to sing at Disneyland but sadly she was shot by Yolanda Saldívar on March 31, 1995. Although she is gone we still remember her for her good talent.
